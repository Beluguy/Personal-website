# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a 2nd year EE student at UBC. 
I am passionate about computers and electronics. 
I enjoy finding connections between what I learn in 
school and my existing knowledge.
Aside from my study, I like to catch up with the latest tech news, 
tinker with electronics, play table tennis, watch sci-fi movies, 
and fly drones (currently learning how to fly FPV!).'

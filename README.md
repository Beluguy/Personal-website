Howdy! I am glad that you found your way to the repo of my portfolio/personal website. This is my first website and I made it with basically no web development experience at all. I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme. Kudos to the [developer - Emruz Hossain
](https://github.com/hossainemruz) for making this theme and the helpful [documentations](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/)!

Things I used:
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a static site generator 
* [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) for a simple, minimal theme
* [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/) for icons
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for background picture
* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for website deployment 
* [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for domain name

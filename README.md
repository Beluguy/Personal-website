Howdy! I am glad that you found your way to the repo of my portfolio/personal website. This is my first website and I made it with basically no web development experience at all. I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) theme, and hosted it on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Kudos to the developer - [Nuno CoraÃ§Ã£o](https://github.com/nunocoracao) for making this beautiful theme and the helpful [documentations](https://blowfish.page/docs/)!


### Things I used:
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a static site generator 
* [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) for a simple, beautiful, and minimal theme
* [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/) for icons
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for background picture
* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for website deployment 
* [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for domain name

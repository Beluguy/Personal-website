Welcome! I'm glad that you stopped by. I am a third year electrical engineering student at [The University of British Columbia][1] (UBC) who is looking for an electronics related internship for summer 2025.

I have worked at [Tenstorrent][2] as a package layout design intern. I am also part of [UBC Rocket][3] (one of UBC's engineering design teams) as an avionics engineer. 

Aside from school, I am passionate about IT, electronics, and space! I like to keep up with the latest tech news, tinker with electronics, play table tennis, watch sci-fi movies, and fly FPV drones.

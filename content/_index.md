Welcome! I'm glad that you stopped by. I am a third year electrical engineering student at [The University of British Columbia][1] (UBC) who is looking for an electronics related internship starting from the winter (January) of 2026 .

I have worked at [Tenstorrent][2] as a package layout design intern. I am also part of [UBC Rocket][3] as the COTS (Commercial-off-the-shelf)  Avionics Hardware Team Lead. 

Aside from school, I am passionate about IT, electronics, and space! I like to keep up with the latest tech news, tinker with electronics, play table tennis, watch sci-fi movies, and fly FPV drones.

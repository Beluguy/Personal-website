My teammates, [Daniel](https://danielzn.com/) and designed and validated the radio communication PCB for North Americanâ€™s first succesful student-made 2 stage rocket, which [won first place](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cw6-koEogTa/) in the advanced category at the Launch Canada 2023 Rocketry Competition.

We made this design using Autodesk Eagle. This was my first time making PCB, so the design is quite simple with only two layers. I will switch to using Altium desinger for future PCBs project because I see many employers prefer that instead of Autodesk Eagle. 

Here are some pictures of our design:
